Here are my notes from the book [Essential Effects](https://essentialeffects.dev/https://essentialeffects.dev/) .  
  
I really love this book as it explained a lot of concepts that are used in functional programming and the cats effect ecosystem.  
  
I love how the examples were concise and practical.

  
I Would have loved if there was more on Testing effects, but there was an introductory chapter.

I totally recommend this book for anyone who wants to dive deeper into functional programming principles and understand more of the cats effect library
